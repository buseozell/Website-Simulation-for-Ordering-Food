## Website Simulation for Ordering Food

The aim of this project was to see how to prepare the right **"Software Development Plan"** rather than coding. As we all know, SDP is very important in ensuring project continuity. For this, we wanted to prepare a website simulation for food order based on the pandemic conditions. While doing this, we aimed to contribute to small tradesmen and to create a mutual benefit between them and the customer.

The English presentation of this project, which is a teamwork of 4 people, which we created in Graphical User Interfaces, was also made.
